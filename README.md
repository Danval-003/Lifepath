# Lifepath
A social network focused on answering the different doubts of people in their exercise routines and sharing the progress they have with and in their diet. All this through a reward system and different routines that encourage the user to continue leading a healthy life. As a complement, a customizable profile will be given with the topics of interest of each person to adapt their diet to their body or the result they would like to achieve, with health and nutrition specialists who act as moderators of the forums and writers from different articles of general and specific interest.
